## Your Name

Passionate and driven junior developer, with a background in Economics and business development.

Having spent time working for a rehabilitation company, I have recently moved into the world of software development and in doing so have discovered a genuine passion for the creativity and problem solving nature involved.

I am looking for the opportunity to continue my learning and development and share ideas with equally passionate people, working on new and exciting projects.

## Skills

Fast Learning

Having started the Makers Academy coding bootcamp with absolutely no prior coding experience, I learnt end-to-end web development using ruby-on-rails and Angular JS, with full test driven design and following agile principles. Over the course of 12 weeks I have become confident using Ruby and Javascript, as well as common frameworks and relational databases. Now that I have a strong and well-principled grounding, I am excited to see what else I can learn over the coming months!

Working in a team

Worked in a 4 person team for the final project at Makers Academy, which involved pairing daily within our group and collaborating via a waffle board. This also taught me a lot about using branching in Github, and resolving lovely merge conflicts.

Business Experience

Having spent approximately 5 years working for a rehabilitation company, I have a great deal of experience in an office environment. I developed skills in working with customers and clients, as well as being responsible for the training and onboarding of new members of staff.

I was also solely responsible for managing a large contract with a customer, which involved a great deal of responsibility and working to weekly deadlines.
